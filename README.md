### Features
* ~~Create a simple app –with Babel– using React, Redux and a router of your election.~~
* ~~Choose the build tool you prefer – we like Webpack~~
* ~~Use any open API you feel more comfortable with – we suggest to use TheMovieDatabase API~~
* The app should contain:
  * ~~A home page listing several categories of items~~
  * ~~A list page to show the items of a selected list~~
  * ~~A detail page of an item with more information~~
* Nice-to-have features:
  * ~~An "Add to cart" button in item's detail page~~
  * ~~A cart to manage the products already added~~
  * ~~Live search~~
* ~~A minimum of clean CSS – do not waste time on fancy styles~~
* ~~Test as much as you can~~
* ~~Pagination -infinite scroll– not mandatory but desirable~~
* SSR not mandatory but desirable
* ~~Create a README file with some documentation~~
* ~~Even better; give us access to the code in some way and deploy the app somewhere giving us access :)~~
